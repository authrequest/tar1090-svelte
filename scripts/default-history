# History configuration
# INTERVAL: How often to fetch aircraft data (in seconds)
INTERVAL=8

# This determines how far back the "recent" history goes
# Default: 450 entries = ~1 hour at 8 second intervals
HISTORY_SIZE=450

# CHUNK_SIZE: Number of snapshots per compressed chunk
# Larger chunks = better compression but slower access
CHUNK_SIZE=60

# PTRACKS: Hours of persistent tracks to keep
# These are used for the ?pTracks visualization showing coverage
# Default: 8 hours
PTRACKS=8

# GZIP_LVL: Compression level (1-9)
# 1 = fastest, least compression
# 9 = slowest, best compression
GZIP_LVL=1

# ENABLE_COMPRESSION: Enable gzip compression of history files
# yes = compressed (saves disk space)
# no = uncompressed (faster access)

# Working directories (usually don't need to change)
